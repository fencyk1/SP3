<h1>Directives Table</h1>

<p>The Directives Table contains a list of all legal directives as well as whether or not they impact memory. <br />
So .start would not impact memory, but Hex.data would. The Directives Table is used for determining whether or not <br />
something is a legal/syntactically correct Directive.<p>
<br />

<p><a href="dirtab.txt">This</a> is how the Directives Table will look in a flat text file for importing into the main program.<p>
<br />

<p>This is an example of the format the Directievs Table will exist in: <p>
<br />

<table border = "1">
<tr>
<th>Directives Table</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Directive</td>
<td>Impacts Memory</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>.start</td>
<td>false</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Int.data</td>
<td>true</td>
