<p>The Symbol Table contains a list all of the variables defined or referenced in the program.<br />
That is to say, it contains the title of the program, all of the labels, the execution start address, etc.<br />
It also conains the location of each symbol, its length, and how it is used. The Symbol Table is sorted by symbol. </p>
